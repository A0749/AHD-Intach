            <h1>Ongoing – Listing of Built Heritage, Diu</h1>
            <p class="p1">
              The Diu Island is marked by its massive Portuguese structures, its
              beaches and its cluster of old residential colonies. The island
              was first captured by many Hindu and Muslims dynasties till 1535
              A.D and then was finally seized by the Portuguese in 1935 A.D: a
              turning point in Diu Architecture. From a glance Diu would appear
              as a landmark of dominating fortress and the catholic churches. To
              witness the real Diu one has to meditate through the intertwining
              lanes of the walled city. The residences of theses lanes speak
              aloud of themselves, the finest carving, the modest facades with
              mesmerizing interiors and the hung glass lamps portrays the aura
              of the people residing here since hundreds of years. It’s the only
              place where one could find the perfect amalgamation of Portuguese
              architecture in pure Indigenous style.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
              The Diu administration and INTACH has taken initiative to list
              these built heritage structures of Diu. A team of conservation
              architects and architects visited the town twice and did a
              comprehensive on-field survey to discover, geo-locate and document
              the structures. The listing is under finalization stage and will
              be submitted to the Diu Administration in near future.

              Identification, Listing And Documentation Of Heritage Sites
              Associated With Swami Vivekananda
            </h1>
            <p class="p3">
              INTACH has been approached by the Ministry of Culture, Govt. of
              India to list and document the buildings/sites associated with
              Swami Vivekananda, especially the buildings which are not under
              the ownership or care of the Ramakrishna Mission. A list of
              buildings has been prepared across 31 towns including Delhi,
              Alwar, Ajmer, Mount Abu, Hrishikesh, Nainital, Srinagar
              (Uttarakhand), Varanasi, Ayodhya, Bhuj, Girnar, Palitana, Dwarka,
              Mahabaleshwar, Panaji, Rameswaram, Pondicherry and others. A team
              of architects from the AH division with support of INTACH chapters
              and local resource persons have been engaged in the survey work. A
              detailed inventory format has been prepared for site survey.
              Assistance from the RK mission centers has also been sought for
              identification and access to the buildings. While most of the
              buildings are found to have been altered, some very significant
              buildings have been demolished in the last decade, such as the
              Seth Shyamaldas Haveli in Roshanara Garden, Delhi.

            <h1>Cultural Resource Mapping In North And South Sikkim</h1>
            <p class="p4">
              A MoU has been signed between the Govt. of Sikkim (Cultural
              Affairs & Heritage Development) and INTACH to survey and update
              the old listing in North and South Sikkim. Architectural Heritage
              Division has surveyed about 160 heritage sites including built
              heritage, natural landscapes, settlements, villages etc spanning
              from a height of 600 feet to 18000 feet. The survey included study
              and documentation of settlement patterns and houses of all three
              predominant communities: Lepcha, Bhutia and Nepalese. The Bhutia
              heartland in the north Sikkim (Chungthang, Lachen, Lachung,
              Yumthang and Thanggu) being the main epicenter of 2011 of
              earthquake, suffered the maximum damage. While many mani Lakhangs,
              Gompas and houses in this area featured in the old list were
              damaged, some of them have been rebuilt and the others are in the
              process of rebuilding. One of the most significant monasteries
              Thanggu at 14000 feet above sea was destroyed in the earthquake
              and has been rebuilt. The survey data is presently being compiled
              in form a listing document.

              Cultural Heritage Mapping In Braj Corridor And Buddhist Circuit
            </h1>
            <p class="p5">
              Architectural Heritage Division of INTACH has been entrusted by
              the world bank to undertake cultural resources mapping in the Braj
              corridor comprising 9 towns (Agra, Mathura, Vrindavan, Nandgaon,
              Barsana, Govardhan, Gokul, Mahavan and Baldeo) and the Buddhist
              circuit covering 3 towns (Sarnath, Kushinagar and Shravasti). The
              mapping involved identification, comprehensive listing, and
              mapping of the heritage assets both tangible and intangible using
              Geographical Information System (GIS).
            </p>
            <h3>Buddhist Circuit</h3>
            <p class="p6">
              Known as the ‘Cradle of Buddhism’, the Buddhist Circuit is dotted
              with monuments, relics, and Jataka tales and so has been a major
              centre for rich architectural and cultural heritage for centuries.
              The survey was undertaken in Sarnath – where Buddha delivered his
              first sermon, Sravasti – where he retreated every monsoon for more
              than 25 years and Kushinagar – where Buddha attained
              Mahaparinirvana covering 40 sites in Sarnath, 39 sites in
              Kushinagar and 59 sites in Sravasti comprising temples,
              monasteries, Stupas, Viharas, meditation centres, archaeological
              ruins and open spaces of immense historic significance.
            </p>
            <h3>Agra – Braj Corridor</h3>
            <p class="p7">
              The towns identified for survey in the Braj Corridor are highly
              significant and due to their association with the legends of Lord
              Krishna and his life. Braj has been the subject of poetry and
              paintings in medieval and late medieval India. The living
              traditions of Braj are encompassed in its unique dialect, folk
              dances and songs, and folk arts and crafts. The survey covered 56
              sites in Mathura, 61 sites in Vrindavan, 34 sites in Gokul, 24
              sites in Mahavan, 11 sites in Baldeo, 37 sites in Barsana, 38
              sites in Nandgaon and 42 sites in Govardhan of immense historic
              significance and are located along various parikrama routes and
              include architectural, natural and intangible heritage of various
              typologies.
